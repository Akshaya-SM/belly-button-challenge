# belly-button-challenge

This challenge demonstrates use of JavaScript to display data on a interactive dashboard. The JSON data is read from an external site using D3. The drop down is populated and the three charts are created with Plotly. The charts will updated based on the drop down selection.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

    - The app.js source file.

    - A dropdown menu to actively change the individual being observed.
    - A demographic table that will reflect the demographic information of the individual selection.

    - Bar Chart
        Shows the top 10 (or all available if less) OTU Samples and their values.
        Hover over to see the exact value and taxa of the sample.
    - Bubble Chart
        Shows all OTUs with the bubble being scaled by Sample Values
        Hover over to see the exact value and taxa of the sample.
